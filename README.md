# The-Damned-World

Earth has been lost to the demons. Vicious creatures that destroy all in their path. But pockets of resistance still exist all over the world. Angels descended to Earth and protect *God's Chosen* from the demonic scurge.

The Battlefield is Earth and neither side is willing to give up.
